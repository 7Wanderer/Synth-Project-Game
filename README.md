# Synth Project Game
 My passion project, an independent game I'm working on.

Syn is a military soldier, waking up in a ruined world with no memory and no weapon except the strange electricity coursing through her.
Play as her as she fights to protect the last of humanity and uncover the truth of what happened to the world that she once knew.

This game is a 3D side-scroller with 2D graphics. The plan is to make both you and the enemies take only 1 hit - be that 1 bullet, 1 attack etc, and that you have to get in close in order to kill, because you don't have weapons. This means that you'll need to play around all the objects in the level, use them to your advantage, and especially focus on your 'blink', a dash with a low cooldown that you can use for some fun movement. Once you get in close, you can attack with an electrokinetic pulse which will send a current through the enemy to stop their heart.
