The world elements, such as the background, floor tiles and object textures will be stored here.
I will have to order them by level, making a Backgrounds and Tiles folder for each level, which will be quite annoying but it is necessary, because this is gonna get complex real quick, with all the parallax textures and the mad amount of tiles.

TODO: 

Remake the test levels background, parallaxes and make more (and better!!!) tiles. At the very least, I need to design them and let Aaron draw them for real.
