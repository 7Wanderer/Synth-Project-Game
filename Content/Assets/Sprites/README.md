This will be where the sprites for each entity will be stored.

Naming convention: [EntityName_AnimationName]. For example, Syn_Run.png.

TODO (Ordered by priority):

Syn
She requires spritesheets for: A running animation, an attacking animation and an idle animation.

Test Enemy
This requires a texture for a projectile (A bullet, I suppose), as well as spritesheets for walking, shooting and idle.

Sasha, Flint
They require spritesheets for: Running and idle animations.
