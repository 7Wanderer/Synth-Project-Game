The world elements, such as the background, floor tiles and object textures will be stored here.
I will have to order them by level, making a Backgrounds and Tiles folder for each level, which will be quite annoying but it is necessary, because this is gonna get complex real quick, with all the parallax textures and the mad amount of tiles.

TODO: 

Test level background (Very basic city, with decrepid buildings
and walls being the parallax) and floor tiles.

Flint's apartment and floor tiles.

A chair.
